COMBAT
Fighting monsters and other characters is a big part of the life of an adventurer in Blackthorne. While we want to keep the game flowing as quickly and smoothly as possible, we missed the tactical mindset towards Combat found in games like D&D and Pathfinder. Thus, during combat, the rules for resolving actions are a little different.

ATTACKING
You can attack your target only if (1) It is your character's turn, and (2) Your target is within the range of the weapon you are currently wielding. 

The only exception to this rule is when an enemy's move (during their turn of course) triggers a reflex attack from you. In that case, you may attack that particular enemy out of your turn, but only if they are within weapon range. Of course, when the tables are turned, enemies may then attack you.

There are 2 types of attacks: Melee and Ranged With the exception of Magical attacks, all attacks are made by rolling a number of dice equal to your skill with the weapon you are using + DEX. Depending on the awareness of your target, your attack can be opposed by a DEFEND roll by your target. Whoever rolls the highest on a single die wins the exchange, with equal numbers cancelling each other out, and with ties being ruled in favor of the target. If your target is unaware of your impending attack, however (as is often the case when you wish to shoot someone from a long distance), you only need to roll a 4 or better on any one die.

Attacking without a weapon:
Attempting to harm your target without a weapon falls into two broad categories: brawling (or scrapping, or fisticuffs, etc.), and grappling. Brawling is when you're trying to bludgeon your target into submission with your bare fists, feet, elbows, teeth, and so on, in which case you roll a number of dice equal to your Unarmed Combat skill + STR. This is opposed by your target's weapon skill rating (if he is currently using one) + his shield rating (again, if he has one). Otherwise, it becomes a straight-up Unarmed Combat versus roll.

Grappling covers those actions wherein you are trying to tackle your target to the ground or perhaps apply a submission hold or a combination of both. The idea is you are trying to restrain your target's actions in some way or other. Roll a number of dice equal to your Grappling skill + either STR or DEX (your choice). Your opponent opposes this roll with the same.

Critical Successes & Failures
Critical successes and failures can only occur on your turn. Critical hits occur only when the conditions for the rolled number of dice are met AND are unopposed by the Defender. Critical failures occur as normal--i.e., only when all the dice rolled result in 1.

Dealing Damage:
When an attack is successful, the GM will call for the attacker to deal damage. This is accomplished by rolling the number of dice equal to the damage rating of the weapon that did the damage. If the target is wearing armor, the target rolls his armor rating, and subtracts the result from the result of the attacker's damage roll. The result, if greater than zero, is the number of points to deduct from the target's HP.

Successful crits by the attacker allows him to roll twice for damage, dealing damage equal to the sum of the two rolls.

DEFENDING
When it is your turn to be attacked, it is usually possible to attempt to defend yourself. When your enemy makes an opposable melee attack roll against you, you may roll a number of dice equal to your skill with the weapon you currently wield + DEX + your shield rating, if you are wielding a shield as well.

When you are the target of a ranged attack, however, you can only attempt to defend yourself if and only if you are aware you are about to be attacked. This means that the target of a ranged attack CANNOT defend himself in the event of a surprise attack.

Once you are aware you are being shot at, you may roll a number of dice equal to your DEX + your shield's rating (if you have a shield to begin with). Whoever rolls the highest number on a single die wins the exchange.
