BlackThorne is a skill-based game -- meaning, character progression is measured by both the number of skills they possess, and how well they can actually perform these skills in-game. There are skills for nearly everything, and no one can learn them all. Thus, it is important that players have a clear idea of the character they would like to build and base their in-game decisions on that.

Furthermore, BlackThorne is a system where you only get good at the things you do -- or to be more accurate, at the things you have your character do. If the character is always trying to climb trees and walls, his Climb skill increases, even if he fails most of the time in the trying. Eventually, he will be able to climb pretty much anything with the speed of a cat and the agility of a monkey.

There are three broad types of skills: Social, Combat, and Adventuring.

Social skills deal with interactions between the PCs and NPCs. Persuade is a Social skill, and Intimidate as well. Haggle is a social skill, but Appraise is not, since assessing the value of a material or item does not require NPC interaction.

Combat skills, of course, deal with combat, from your character's skill at swinging a sword to their ability to dodge and sidestep a blow. Light Blades is a combat skill dealing with knives and daggers, while Heavy Bludgeoning deals with iron-headed warhammers and two-handed mauls.

Adventuring skills are those skills that cannot be classified into either Social or Combat skills. Alchemy is one such skill, and so is Ride. Adventuring skills cover a very broad range of skills and specializations, from knowing things about the world to creating things from raw materials.
