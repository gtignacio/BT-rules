BlackThorne is a skill-based game -- meaning, character progression is measured by both the number of skills they possess, and how well they can actually perform these skills in-game. There are skills for nearly everything, and no one can learn them all. Thus, it is important that players have a clear idea of the character they would like to build and base their in-game decisions on that.

Furthermore, BlackThorne is a system where you only get good at the things you do -- or to be more accurate, at the things you have your character do. If the character is always trying to climb trees and walls, his Climb skill increases, even if he fails most of the time.
